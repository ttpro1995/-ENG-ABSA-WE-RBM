<ambience><positive><neutral><0> in short in nice weather , the front doors are flung open to the air ; cold nights find patrons tucked into rear booths . </0></neutral></positive></ambience>
<miscellaneous><1> the place is popular with locals . </1></miscellaneous>
<food><positive><2> the food is a melding of moroccan comfort food and spanish tapas fare : tagines , stews and salads , with surprises like baby eggplants and olives where you might not expect them . </2></positive></food>
<food><positive><3> dishes are best shared with groups , as are the pitchers of sangria . </3></positive></food>

<staff><negative><0> i like cafe noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! ! </0></negative></staff>
<staff><negative><1> the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served . </1></negative></staff>
<staff><negative><2> the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing . </2></negative></staff>
<anecdotes><negative><3> after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from ...maybe you dont know how things work in america ...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on . </3></negative></anecdotes>
<anecdotes><4> we did tip , i guess the model just wanted more and complained to the manager . </4></anecdotes>
<staff><5> the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place . </5></staff>

<staff><anecdotes><negative><conflict><0> i went to meet friends for happy hour the other day and the service was soooo horrible and blatantly rude that we left - the first time i have ever left a place because of the service - and it was not just me - there were at least 5-7 of us all standing around this small bar trying to get a drink for 30 minutes or more - the bartender would look at me ( or others ) and we would say what we wanted - and then for fun - he wouldnt make it - it was almost comical - except that was soo blatantly rude . </0></conflict></negative></anecdotes></staff>
<miscellaneous><1> by far the worst restaurant in the city that i have been too - and ive been to lots of bars and restaurants in the city .... </1></miscellaneous>

<ambience><miscellaneous><positive><0> this place is n't all bad : the music is good and the locaiton is fun . </0></positive></miscellaneous></ambience>
<staff><1> the service leaves much to be desired , however . </1></staff>
<food><staff><negative><2> they have the attitude that you are lucky to be served by them . </2></negative></staff></food>
<anecdotes><negative><3> last time i was there , a very high-strung man kicked us off of our table since he said we 'd been there too long--meanwhile two out of three of us were n't finished yet . </3></negative></anecdotes>
<food><anecdotes><4> we probably would have happily paid and left had he been congenial about it , but he was oddly-confrontational from the outset . </4></anecdotes></food>
<food><price><negative><5> bottom line : if you want to pay absurd prices for horrible service and mediocre ( over-salted ) food , this is where you should go . </5></negative></price></food>
